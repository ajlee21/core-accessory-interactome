# Pilot: exploring core-accessory relationships within an individual experiment

**April 2020**

This pilot analysis will serve to answer the question: What is the simplest analysis that will convince us that [aim 2](../README.md) is worth pursuing?


*Question:*  What relationships between core and accessory genes can we find using small subset of samples? 

*Approach:*
1. Select an experiment from the [*P. aeruginosa* compendium](https://msystems.asm.org/content/1/1/e00025-15)
2. Map PAO1-only, PA14-only, PAO1/PA14 homolog annotations to transcriptome data
Note: We are using PAO1 and PA14 genotypes since they are well established.
3. Explore core-accessory relationships: What is the correlation between core-only genes, accessory-only genes, core-accessory genes? What explains the correlation structure (i.e. co-operonic, shared pathways)? What is known about core-accessory relationships?
